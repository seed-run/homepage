title: Adding a Stage
---

Seed supports both [branch based workflow]({% link _docs/working-with-branches.md %}) and [pull request based workflow]({% link _docs/working-with-pull-requests.md %}). In this chapter let's look at how to deploy individual Git branches to different stages.

Create a new branch.

``` bash
$ git checkout -b new-branch
```

Push the branch to remote.

``` bash
$ git push -u origin new-branch
```

Go to the Seed console, select the **Pipeline** tab, and click the **Edit Pipeline** link.

We cover the various aspects of the pipeline editor in the [Editing the Pipeline]({% link _docs/editing-the-pipeline.md %}) chapter. But for now hit the **Add a Stage** button.

![Click add a Stage Button](/assets/docs/adding-a-stage/click-add-a-stage.png)

Here you can pick a stage name. And optionally select if a branch you want to connect it to. If connected to a stage, Seed will auto-deploy to this stage when you `git push` to the branch. You can always [configure the auto-deploy settings later]({% link _docs/updating-the-stage-source.md %}#auto-deploy-options).

![Select Branch](/assets/docs/adding-a-stage/select-branch.png)

The stage name is used internally while deploying the project via `serverless deploy --stage SEED_STAGE_NAME`. The stage name is also used to [configure stage variables]({% link _docs/configuring-stage-variables.md %}). 

You can also optionally copy the settings from an existing stage by selecting **Inherit settings from an existing stage**.

![Inherit settings from an existing stage](/assets/docs/adding-a-stage/inherit-settings-from-an-existing-stage.png)

If you select a stage to inherit from, Seed will copy over the following to your new stage:

- IAM settings
- Notification settings
- Environment variables

Once a stage is created, it is available across all the services in the app.

![New stage added](/assets/docs/adding-a-stage/new-stage-added.png)

You start the first build for the stage by either hitting **Deploy** or by pushing a commit to the branch that is linked to the stage.

![Build stage in progress](/assets/docs/adding-a-stage/build-stage-in-progress.png)

If the build is successful and tests pass, all the services get deployed to this stage. At the same time, a verified build is packaged for production. You can read more about this in the [Promoting to production]({% link _docs/promoting-to-production.md %}) chapter.

Once a stage has been added, Seed will automatically create a new build when you `git push` to the update the remote branch.

Finally, you can configure Seed to automatically create and remove stages when a new Git branch is created or removed. You can read more about this in the [Working with Branches chapter]({% link _docs/working-with-branches.md %}).

You can also set a stage to replace your production stage or set it as a pre-production (or staging) stage. You can read about this in detail in the [Editing the Pipeline]({% link _docs/editing-the-pipeline.md %}) chapter.
