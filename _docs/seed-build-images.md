title: Seed Build Images
---

Seed runs your builds inside a virtual machine and it'll use a build image based on the Lambda runtime of your service. Below is a list of all the images in use:

[**Active Images**](#build-images)

- [General Purpose Latest](#general-purpose-latest)
- [General Purpose v4.0](#general-purpose-v40)
- [General Purpose v3.0](#general-purpose-v30)
- [General Purpose v1.1](#general-purpose-v11)
- [Python 3.6](#python-36)
- [Python 2.7](#python-27)
- [Ruby 2.5](#ruby-25)

[**Deprecated Images**](#deprecated-build-images)

- [General Purpose v2.0](#general-purpose-v20)
- [General Purpose v1.0](#general-purpose-v10)
- [Python 3.7](#python-37)
- [.NET Core 2.1](#net-core-21)

## Changing the Build Image

By default, Seed will automatically select a build image for your service based on the runtime you have set in your `serverless.yml`. However, Seed will not automatically update this when your runtime is updated. This is done to ensure that any scripts in your [build spec]({% link _docs/adding-a-build-spec.md %}) are not affected by the build image change.

If you want to update the build image that a service in your app is using, head over to the service's settings.

![Build image option in service settings](/assets/docs/seed-build-images/build-image-option-in-service-settings.png)

Note that, if a service has not been deployed yet, Seed will not have picked a build image.

You can also check which image was used for a specific build, by heading over to the logs for that build.

## Running Locally

The build images used in Seed are hosted on Docker Hub â€” [**seedrun/build**](https://hub.docker.com/r/seedrun/build/tags)

These images are useful if you are trying to debug build issues. You can set up a Seed-like build environment locally to test your project.

To start the environment:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it --privileged seedrun/build:general-purpose-5.0 bash
```

Make sure to select the build image your service is using.

The default working directory for builds in Seed is `/tmp/seed/source`. To clone the source, run:

```bash
$ mkdir -p /tmp/seed
$ cd /tmp/seed
$ git clone https://github.com/my/repo source
$ cd source
```

## Build Images

Below are the build images that are used and the types of services they are used for. A build image is chosen based on the Lambda runtime of the service.

### General Purpose Latest

You should use the General Purpose Latest build image. It is regularly updated to the latest security patches and runtimes. The General Purpose Latest image is also pre-cached on our build machines.

Lambda runtimes: Node.js 22.x, Node.js 20.x, Node.js 18.x, Node.js 16.x, Python 3.11, Python 3.10, Go 1.x, Ruby 3.2, Java 17

OS: Ubuntu 22.04

| Includes         | Version  |
| ---------------- | :------: |
| Node.js          |  18.120  |
| Python           |   3.11   |
| Ruby             |   3.2    |
| Go               |   1.20   |
| .NET Core        | 6.0, 8.0 |
| Java             |    17    |
| PHP              |   8.2    |
| NPM              |   10.7   |
| PNPM             |   9.14   |
| YARN             |   1.22   |
| PIP              |   24.0   |
| Docker\*         |   26.1   |
| Docker Compose\* |   2.27   |

\*[Docker and Docker Compose need to be enabled.]({% link _docs/docker-commands-in-your-builds.md %})

If you want to use a different version of a package than the one that is on the build image, add the following to your [build spec]({% link _docs/adding-a-build-spec.md %}) (`seed.yml`):

#### Customizing Node Versions

Seed uses [n](https://github.com/tj/n) to manage Node.js versions. To use a different version, update your `seed.yml` with:

```yml
before_compile:
  - n 18.14.0
```

#### Customizing Golang Versions

Seed uses [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) to manage Go versions. To use a different version:

```yml
before_compile:
  - cd $HOME/.goenv && git pull && goenv install 1.16.4 && goenv global 1.16.4
```

#### Customizing Python versions

Seed uses [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions. To use a different version:

```yml
before_compile:
  - cd /root/.pyenv/plugins/python-build/../.. && git pull && pyenv install 3.11.4 && pyenv global 3.11.4
```

#### Customizing .NET versions

Seed uses [env tool](https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh) to manage .NET versions. The [General Purpose Latest](#general-purpose-latest) image has both .NET 6.0 and 8.0 preloaded.

To use .NET 8.0:

```yml
before_compile:
  - dotnet new globaljson --force --sdk-version 8.0.0 --roll-forward feature
```

To use a different version:

```yml
before_compile:
  - /usr/local/bin/dotnet-install.sh -v 6.0.300
```

#### Customizing Npm Versions

You can install the version of npm you want in the same way. For example, if you wanted to use the latest version of npm, add the following.

```yml
before_compile:
  - npm i -g npm@latest
```

#### Customizing Pip Versions

Update Pip to the latest version.

```yml
before_compile:
  - pip install --upgrade pip
```

Alternatively, you can select the specific version of Pip you want.

```yml
before_compile:
  - pip install --upgrade "pip==21.1.2"
```
